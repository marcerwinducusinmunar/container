					<h3>Iceland</h3>
					<p> Iceland -an island from the continent of Europe, located in the North Atlantic Ocean. With a neighbouring island -Greenland, from the continent of North America. Possessing priceless beauty with its rift valleys, geysers, hotsprings, rhyolite mountains, columnar basalt formations, lava fields and lunar-like craters. <br> <br> Iceland was formed from volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic ridge for about 24 million years. Iceland is the only place where you can stand on the ridge on dry land. That makes Iceland very special and a popular place for geologists to visit and do their researches.</p>

				<h4> The Land of Fire and Ice</h4>
				<p>Iceland is a country that is aptly known as the "Land of Fire and Ice". It is an island born out of volcanic eruptions over millions of years. The island was buried under ice 8000 years ago. Slowly, the glaciers melted and carved the island's spectacular valleys and fjords. The present day people are primarily of Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish origin. </p>
